								<h3>QUALIFICATION</h3>
								<p>Must be a graduating grade 12 student. Must have qualifying marks in the college entrance exam (if any)</p>

								<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>

								<h4>Academic Records</h4>
								<p>Academic records are documents that show your grades throughout high school and senior high school. These include report cards (Form 138) and transcript of records (Form 137). Schools may request either one or both of these documents. Aside from being proof of your secondary education, they serve as a way for the school to see whether or not you will be able to keep up with your academic performance in college. Mahalaga rin ang mga academic records if you’re applying for a scholarship!</p>
								<p>Where to get: Registrar</p>
								<p>How much: Fee varies per document and per school</p>

								<h4>Certificate of Good Moral Character</h4>
								<p>Your grades show your academic performance in numbers, while a certificate of good moral speaks of your character. Schools have rules and regulations students must follow. Some of which includes rules about academic honesty, bullying, attendance, and more. This document shows your disciplinary record throughout your time in high school.</p>
								<p>Where to get: Discipline Office, Guidance Office</p>
								<p>How much: Fee varies per school</p>

								<h4>Letters of Recommendation</h4>
								<p>Another document that can vouch for your character is a recommendation letter. Isa itong dokumento para mas makilala ka pa ng college o university na gusto mong pasukan. Recommendation letters often include a teacher’s personal assessment of a student, and the reasons why you are a good candidate for the college you’re applying to. Think of it as someone ‘putting in a good word for you’. Take note that colleges may or may not have a preferred format for the letter. Either way, it’s best to get a recommendation letter from a teacher who knows you well!</p>
								<p>Where to get: You can request a letter of recommendation from the Principal’s Office or Guidance Office. You can also ask directly from a teacher of your choice.</p>
								<p>How much: Free, but ask nicely!</p>

								<h4>PSA/NSO Birth Certificate</h4>
								<p>A birth certificate is an important document because it’s a valid proof of identity. It indicates your basic details such as name, age, citizenship, and status. 
It’s a way for the school to verify the personal information you put on your application form. In other words, schools use this to make sure that you are who you say you are!
                                
Where to get: PSA Serbilis Website, PSA Helpline
                                
How much: Php 365.00
                                
Some schools might request for your Senior High School Diploma and your ID pictures, so it’s good to have these ready too. 
It’s best to prepare the original and photocopies of all the requirements.</p>
